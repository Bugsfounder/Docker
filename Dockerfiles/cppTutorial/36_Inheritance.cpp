/*INHERITANCE IN C++ OVERVIEW:-
-Reusability is a very important concept of oops.
-In C++ we reuse a class and add additional features in it.
-Reusing a class saves time and money.
-Reusing already tested and debugged class is saves our a lot of efforts.
-The property of reusability is using in C++ by inheritance.
-We use the properties of existing class by inheritance.
-BASE CLASS: existing class is base class.
-DERIVED CLASS: the new class which is inherited.
*/
/*TYPES OF INHERITANCE:-
There are 5 types of inheritance.
    1.SINGLE: A derived class with one base class. [A--->B]{A drives B}
    2.MULTIPLE: A derived class with more then one base class.
    3.HIERARCHICAL: Several derived classes with one base class.
    4.MULTILEVEL: Derived a class with already derived class. [A-->B-->C]
    5.HYBRID: Mixer of multilevel and multiple inheritance.
